# Zern Downgrader
Allows You To Downgrade any app versions using build ids, the api is hosted by me as im not ok with meta insta killing this.

If you dont know how to get your own access token please refer to the docs by computerelite here: https://computerelite.github.io/tools/Oculus/ObtainToken.html

Build ids for apps can be obtained by going to Oculus DB and finding the build id of the app you wish to download it should look like this: 29917931171155937
